    ## Why DGI-UI?

    When it comes to building user interfaces, you're usually stuck with three options, each with a different set of trade-offs.

    ### Normal Component Libraries
    - **Pros:** These come with ready-to-use components that are styled, functional, and accessible right out of the box.
    - **Cons:** Good luck trying to customize them without losing your mind. Customization constraints restrict your creative flow.

    ### Building Custom Components
    - **Pros:** You’re the master of your domain, dictating every aspect of design and functionality.
    - **Cons:** Yet, this power comes at a price. It’s a labor-intensive, tedious, resource-draining process, riddled with pitfalls like accessibility nightmares and browser quirks. Onboarding for new developers can be tricky.

    ### Unstyled Component Libraries
    - **Pros:** These offer pre-built components with rock-solid functionality, accessibility, and browser compatibility. They hand you the reins for styling, saving you from reinventing the wheel and ensuring best practices.
    - **Cons:** If you're aiming for extensive customization, it's a marathon. It’s all on you to maintain design cohesion across the board, a task that can become a daunting effort as your application grows and evolves.
